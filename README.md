I am a researcher at at the French National Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE) in Aix-en-Provence, France. I combine theoretical models and empirical data to better understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of temperature on phenotypic traits, trophic interactions, community dynamics, and ecosystem functioning. My broad interests are to further understanding on the ecological and evolutionary impacts of global change at multiple biological scales.
